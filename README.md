# EstateHub — Real Estate Agency Website

A complete real estate agency website: **React (Vite) frontend** + **Node.js / Express API backend**.

```
estate-hub/
├── server/          Express REST API (JSON-file persistence, JWT auth)
└── client/          React 18 SPA (Vite, React Router)
```

## Quick start

### 1. Backend (port 3001)

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start        # or: npm run dev  (watch mode)
```

Data auto-seeds on first boot into `server/data/*.json` (48 properties, 4 agents, 6 services, 6 testimonials).
Delete those files and restart to reset the demo data.

### 2. Frontend (port 5173)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:3001`. Open <http://localhost:5173>.

### Production (single port)

```bash
cd client && npm run build     # emits client/dist
cd ../server && npm start      # serves dist + /api on one port
```

## Configuration

`server/.env` (optional):

```
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=change-me-in-production
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

`client/.env` (optional):

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api   # defaults to the dev proxy "/api"
```

## Tech notes

- No database required — `server/src/db.js` is a tiny cached JSON store; swap it for MongoDB/Postgres without touching the routes.
- Styling is a single hand-written design system (`client/src/styles.css`): navy + gold palette, Fraunces/Inter typography, fully responsive with no UI library.
- Favorites persist in `localStorage`; the `/api/favorites` endpoints are available for server-side sync.

## Images

All imagery is **bundled locally** (no external image CDNs), so it works offline and can't break.

- Placeholder home/office/hero/avatar artwork lives in `client/public/images/` as lightweight SVGs.
- The backend seed references them via relative `/images/...` paths, which the SPA resolves to its own origin (Vite in dev, Express in production).
- To regenerate the artwork: `cd client && npm run images`.
- To use real photography later, just point the seed data / new listings at your own image URLs or upload files into `client/public/images/`.
